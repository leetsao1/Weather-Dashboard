<a name="Description">Description:</a>

This weather application works by getting a location name and converting that into a map latitude and longitude. The value is then sent to a free API (openweathermap.org) where the desired information is returned as an object that is used to extract data and overwrite the html document.

Documents:
Weather.js - contains all logic and functions for calling the weather API
Index.html -  contains all basic html to support all the javascript on weather.JS
